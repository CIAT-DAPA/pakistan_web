Improved extension,"Effective agricultural extension is vital to provide farmers with information and training on the latest agricultural practices, new technologies or updates on the most suitable cropping systems/ crop and livestock varieties. In many cases extension is a farmer’s primary source of agriculture related information and training. Changing climatic conditions and the introduction of unknown pests and disease leaves farmers requiring additional extension support, as traditional practices become less effective. "
Agricultural research services,"Agricultural research services play an important role in improving the understanding of risks at a farm level and identifying contextually specific interventions. However, agricultural research spending relative to agricultural GDP in Pakistan is the lowest in South Asia. Research has shown that the current Pakistan agricultural research system will need to leverage five to six times the funding, compared to present levels to be optimally funded."
Microfinance,"Many CSA practices and technologies that will improve farm productivity require upfront investment. Resource poor farmers are often unable to afford this initial investment despite the potential returns. The scaling up of microfinance institutions and the removal of barriers (collateral, land tenure) that are stopping smallholder farmers accessing credit, will facilitate greater investment in the agriculture sector, driving modernization and boosting productivity.   "
Savings & Credit groups,"Many small farmers and share croppers struggle to meet the criteria for accessing formal credit markets, and are left exposed to high interest rates of the informal sector. The formation of community savings and credit groups has been found to be an effective means for communities to improve their access to finance, through the pooling of their financial resources to provide concessional loans. "
Vocational courses,"In order to improve the capacity of the agricultural workforce and create more opportunities for skilled labour in farming areas, there is a need for vocational courses to provide training on advanced farming and processing methods. This is particularly important considering the extent to which the youth are migrating away from farming areas in search of alternative livelihoods. Current training through polytechnics and apprenticeship programs is perceived to not offer clear career pathways. A more skilled workforce would support the growth of the agriculture sector and facilitate the establishment of rural enterprises. "
Mechanisation,"The mechanization of agricultural production can greatly improve productivity. In Pakistan, low agricultural productivity is directly related to the unavailability of appropriate agricultural machinery to farmers at the right time, thereby delaying optimal land preparation, sowing and harvesting dates. This can limit up to 10-15% of additional potential yield for farmers. "
Equal access to education & finance,"Equal access to education and finance is directly linked to the empowerment of women through the creation of economic opportunities and enhanced family welfare. In Pakistan, women farmers face a shortage of information, with only 5% of agricultural extension services being specifically targeted towards women. While access to finance for women has increased by 5.7 million people from 2008 to 2015, there is still 57% of women who remain financially excluded from formal financial services. "
Provision of high quality/ improved seed/Breed ,"In Pakistan, only a small portion of seed demand is met by the private sector. A majority of farmers receive seeds from the informal sector, whether through seed exchanges with other farmers, using seeds from the previous season or buying uncertified seeds from input providers. Further research and provision of high-quality seeds and breeds will ensure quality produce—more resilient to pests, diseases and climatic conditions—thus enhancing income for farmers."
Price/Market information,"Providing adequate market information is essential to farmers to become market-oriented and align agricultural production decisions towards consumer demands. Access to reliable market information can assist farmers in a wide range of decision-making processes, including; which crops to grow, when is the best time to sell (out of season), where to sell their products, and to understand if the prices offered by traders are in-line with market prices. Evidence suggests that enhanced access to market information can directly affect farmer’s risk perceptions in agricultural production."
Youth engagement activities,"Pakistan’s youth are increasingly looking to alternative sectors for employment due to a perceived lack of opportunity in agriculture. This threatens the long-term sustainability of the agriculture sector. The increased provision of youth education and training models have the opportunity to re-engage this demographic with agriculture, tackling unemployment issues in rural areas."
Post-harvest loss management,"Pakistan farmers face many challenges regarding post-harvest losses, ranging from poor pre-harvest production techniques, improper care of harvest, handling, storage and distribution processes. This issue is especially relevant for fresh fruits and vegetables, where quality begins to deteriorate right after harvest. By leveraging improved post-harvest practices, farmers can enhance their income significantly."
Formation of cooperatives / Producer groups,"Producer groups and cooperatives can hold important roles within rural communities, as they act as a central representative body to facilitate internal dialogues among farmers and external negotiations with service providers and market agents. Specifically, producer groups and cooperatives can; represent fragmented smallholders in policy dialogues and price negotiations; act as the coordinating body for the delivery of information and training to their members; provide discounted services; improve access to agricultural credit; and facilitating farmer access to markets. "
Subsidies / Incentives (policy support),"To promote the adoption of agricultural practices and technologies that not only offer the best private benefits to farmers but have positive social and environmental impacts, the government may need to offer subsidies of policy incentives. Therefore, the use of targeted government agricultural support, that not only promotes production but the use of appropriate production methods could drive greater CSA adoption rates. "
Price regulations,"The only crop with supported prices in Pakistan currently is Wheat, where the government has set a price floor, buying up any surplus production. While the removal of the public sector support from other commodities has saved government funds, this has left the burden of the cost up to farmers. High production costs and low return may disincentivize farmers from diversifying crops and changing agricultural practices. Likewise, the protection of farmers from volatile input markets through input price regulations can ensure economic viability for farmers, safeguarding national food security. "
Integration of gender issues into FFS curriculum,"Farmer field schools are a training approach that is participatory in nature, utilized by agricultural extension systems to train farmers on improved agricultural techniques and technologies. Incorporation of gender issues within this curriculum will help to empower women to take part in the decision-making processes, and improve equality in access to and control of capital for economic development."
E-advisory (Internet & Apps),"There is great information asymmetry in Pakistan, with large-scale farmers having greater access to agricultural advisory services. With increasing access to the internet through mobile phones, e-advisory services can act as a useful and effective medium, particularly for remote communities. This would help them stay informed through weather forecasts, early warning, and information on best practices.  "
Improved local sorting and processing facilities (Increasing value addition & decreasing post-harvest losses),"Improving the farmer’s capacity to conduct on-farm or local-level processing can enhance the value of their produce, thus securing a higher profit for farmers. In addition, local sorting and processing facilities can provide further opportunities for woman and youth to become involved in commercial activities. To facilitate these activities, there needs to be increased investments in processing facilities, training for marketing activities and training on quality assurance of processed goods. "
Formation of woman’s groups,"Women producers face many challenges whilst participating in agricultural production, such as cultural and social discrimination, which can prevent them from the access to capital, finance, education and new technologies. While woman play a critical role on farms, they are often seen doing the less skilled tasks for little to no remuneration. The establishment of woman’s groups would help women organize themselves, sharing knowledge and advice on agricultural and non-agricultural issues, and increase their social and economic status. "
Improved farm to market roads,"Poor farm to market roads is one of the major issues within the agricultural sector in Pakistan. In combination with poor transportation facilities and a lack of adequate post-harvest storage infrastructure, farmers have to endure high transportation costs and losses to get their produce to market. Improving farm to market roads will reduce these costs to farmers and further facilitate economic development for communities."
ICT based weather forecasting,"The utilization of ICTs for weather forecasting will allow greater access to agro climatic information by farmers across Pakistan. Whether through TV, radio broadcasts, smart phone apps, or websites, farmers can readily access information on forecasts when needed. Nonetheless, in Pakistan, challenges exist for the development of ICTs for agricultural extension, ranging from poor IT infrastructure, limited energy availability, and un-targeted top-down one-way information flows. "
Improved storage (post-harvest loss management),"Storage of food grain crops is a significant phase of the post-harvesting process. Many agricultural commodities are seasonal, perishable and required advanced storage techniques. When there is excess supply of commodities, farmers can use storage facilities to store this supply, gradually releasing them to market during the off-season for better prices. Without adequate facilities, farmers will have to sell directly their products to traders and processors within a short period of time at low prices. "
Early warning,"With weather conditions becoming increasingly uncertain, both in terms of timing and intensity, the presence of early warning systems is vital for farmers to adequately prepare and mitigate agricultural losses. The effectiveness of these systems depends on the capacity of hydro-meterological offices to produce adequate data, and agricultural extension systems effectively translating and delivering them to end-users in a targeted manner."
Financial management training,"Better financial management skills will enable farmers to make more effective use of available financial resources and increase access to financial services. While farmers often prefer to concentrate on production, varying prices in input costs, commodity price volatility and the ability to access capital calls for better financial and risk management skills. The four key areas that make up financial management involves: (1) literacy skills (2) analyzing skills (3) planning skills) and (4) record-keeping skills. "
Youth loan programme,"Youth loan programmes play an important role in attracting youth to work in agriculture. Lack of access to credit has a significant negative effect on the participation of rural youth farmers in agricultural activities. Young farmers, who are often more inclined to adopt new technologies and innovative practices for enhanced farm production, can receive access to the needed startup capital. These loan programmes thus act as a powerful tool to enhance incomes, savings and capital accumulation to break out from the cycle of poverty."
Support service provider,"Agricultural service providers play a vital role in ensuring crop and livestock productivity for farmers. The timely provision of these services, whether in animal veterinary services, land preparation, planting, spraying, threshing, storing or transportation, are a major factors in determining successful production. Consequently, the lack of availability and access to these resources, in a timely matter can result in large losses. "
Radio & TV Programmes (weather & advisory),"Radio and TV programmes are the two most accessible information dissemination channels for farmers to receive advisory services. Nonetheless, these mediums require careful targeting and information delivery, as evidence suggests that farmers prefer hands-on training and discussions for in-depth information."
Index based insurance,"Index based insurance is a new insurance paradigm, where payouts are linked to a measured index comprised of environmental conditions and variables that directly relate to losses in agricultural production. When the index exceeds a specific threshold, farmers receive a payout for their estimated losses. In rainfed areas of Pakistan, where there is large unpredictability in precipitation, this type of insurance scheme can be especially relevant, and may promote the adoption of higher-value crops due to reduced production risks for farmers. "
Group based revolving funds,"Limited access to agricultural credit undermines the economic development of rural economies.  Group-based revolving funds allow for resource accumulation at community level, and can be important credit and grant schemes to allow farmers access to capital. These funds can also incentivize savings habit to enhance individual financial capacity. The use of these funds can be not only for production purposes but also to meet emergency needs like health care and education. "
