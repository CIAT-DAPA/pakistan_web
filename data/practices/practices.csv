Sindh,Tharparkar,Millet,Crop Rotation,Adopted <30%,Soil & Nutrient,Biodiversity,Plant Animal health,Yield Income,Carbon,Water,Crop rotation increases total production and productivity per unit area of land. Harvests of multiple crops from this system increase farmer’s income and food security.,This practice reduces the risk of total crop failure due to diversification of crops under climatic shocks. Improves soil fertility. Rotating crops maintains soil fertility and minimizes the incidence of pests and diseases.,"The practice of crop rotation helps to protect soil structure, increases soil organic matter and organic carbon reserves.
