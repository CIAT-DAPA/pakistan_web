CA also reduces costs associated with tillage, whether manual or by machinery by 15-20% in Malawi [1]. 
The reduction in field preparations with CA also allows timelier planting, which supports successful harvests [1]
","CA increases soil water content by increasing infiltration and reducing runoff and evaporation thus improves water use efficiency and buffers crops against drought. 
Mulch cover also buffers the soil against temperature extremes. 
Reducing tillage and maintaining soil cover with crop residues can reduce erosion by up to 80%. [1]
